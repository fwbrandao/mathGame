# mathGame
It's a game for kinds who are starting learning math.
The game consists in teaching kids how to do simple math calculation.
But for it not to be too boring, i thought in build a simple game.

There will be you (avatar) standing at some pilar.

The pilar is about to colapse, you have to jamp to another pilar.

There's 2 (or 3, haven't decided yet) pilars in front of you with some numbers.

You have the question 2 + 2 on the screem.
